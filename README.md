# Monja
Implementing my own version of React.

Based on [@pomber](https://github.com/pomber/didact)`s [Didact](https://github.com/pomber/didact).

## To do

- Add more hooks (useEffect, useMemo, etc.)
- Use and object for the style prop instead of a string
- Reconciliation by key
- Implement my own webpack config
- Remove react-scripts from the project
- Add Typescript types
